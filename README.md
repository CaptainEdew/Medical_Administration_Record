# Medical_Administration_Record
This is a personal MAR that I built. Very simple, stores data in SQL database, uses checkboxes to note administration.
The database imports some info from plain text/csv files upon creation. 
Checkboxes will disable if associated day is in the past, so no retroactive administration possible.
Checkboxes also disable after administration(checkbox is checked) and program closed.
Drug names redacted for PHI purposes.
